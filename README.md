# Arch-Hyprland-Config
# My Own Personal Hyprland configuration
Hyprland is Wndow Tile Manager in Arch Linux.
These are what i'm using on my hyprland:
1. Status bar : Waybar
2. Application Launcher : rofi
3. wallpaper : Hyprpaper
4. Notifcation Center : Swaync

## Personal Notes
1. doesn't need to clone the Project, just download the script "install.sh"
2. do "chmod +x install.sh" for install script to be executable, and run "./install.sh" to execute the script
